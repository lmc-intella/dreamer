# retention_gate.sh — assert a proposed CLAUDE.md slim kept everything that matters.
#
#   retention_gate.sh <original> <proposed>
#
# THE PROBLEM. `claude doctor` proposes CLAUDE.md trims, and a trim is judged by
# how much shorter it got. But the lines worth the most tokens are usually the
# ones worth keeping: an absolute directive nobody re-derives, the one exact
# command that works, a version number someone bled for. Shortening is easy to
# measure and losing a `never` is not, so the cheap metric wins by default.
#
# This is the counterweight, and it is PROPOSE-ONLY BY CONSTRUCTION: it takes two
# files and returns a verdict. It cannot edit anything, so no amount of
# misapplication turns it into a thing that rewrites your instructions.
#
# WHAT MUST SURVIVE — each is something a reader cannot reconstruct:
#   absolute directives   a line carrying never / always / must / do not
#   exact commands        anything in `backticks` that looks executable
#   paths                 file and directory references
#   versions              >=1.10, v2.3.1, 0.9
#   error strings         quoted text that a tool actually emits
#
# "Survives" means the text is still present SOMEWHERE in the proposal, not on
# the same line — reorganising is fine, losing is not.
#
# Exits 0 when everything survived, 1 with one line per loss, 2 on usage error.
